abstract: "Behavioral economic demand methodology is increasingly being used in various fields such as substance use and consumer behavior analysis. Traditional analytical techniques to fitting demand data have proven useful yet some of these approaches present statistical limitations and require preprocessing of data. As an extension to these regression techniques, mixed-effect (or multilevel) modeling can serve as an improvement over these traditional methods. Notable benefits include providing simultaneous group (i.e., population) level and individual level estimates and accommodating the inclusion of 'nonsystematic' response sets as well as covariates. The models can also accommodate complex experimental designs including repeated measures. The goal of this paper is to introduce the mixed-effects modeling techniques applied to behavioral economic demand data. We compare and contrast results from traditional techniques to that of the mixed-effects models differing in species and experimental design,. The relative benefits and drawbacks of both approaches are discussed and access to the statistical code is provided to support the analytical replicability of the comparisons."

# Introduction

The concept of behavioral economic demand (hereafter referred to simply as demand) has 
proven useful in a variety of settings including drug addiction 
[@strickland2020meta; @kaplan2018aptreview; @aston2019behecon; @roz2019cptreview; 
@strickland2020unifying; @acuff2020meta; @strickland2020meta], public 
policy [@hursh2013public], health behaviors [@bickel2016health], and others 
[@gilroy2018systematic; @kaplan2017greenbags; @henley2016workplace; 
@strickland2020condom; @hayashi2019texting; @yates2019enrichment; @reed2016uvit]. 
Demand has been evaluated in
a both humans and nonhuman animals [@strickland2020unifying; @bentzley2012selfad; @fragale2017neg].
Methods for elucidating trends
in consumption and demand have included experiential self-administration 
[@johnson2006replacing] and hypothetical responding [@strickland2020meta]. 

The economic concept of demand characterizes the relationship between the 
consumption or purchasing of a substance or commodity and some constraint, such 
as price [@reed2013behecon]. In nonhuman animal self-administration work, demand is captured 
by (i) increasing the ratio requirement necessary to obtain the reinforcer, 
and/or (ii) decreasing the dose of the reinforcer while keeping the response 
requirement constant. This ratio of cost (e.g., responses)
to benefit (e.g., drug obtained) is referred to as unit price[^1]. In human work, 
participants may self-administer or endorse their hypothetical consumption of the 
reinforcers (e.g., alcoholic drinks, cigarettes) across a range of prices. This latter
approach is commonly referred to as a Hypothetical Purchase Task [@roma2015hpts]. In 
*behavioral economics* rooted in the operant framework, the relation
between reinforcer price and consumption typically follows
a nonlinear relationship, where increments in low prices are met with relatively
little change in consumption and relatively more rapid declines in consumption are
observed as prices increase (see Figure \@ref(fig:illustrate-demand-approaches-plot)). 
A core aspect resulting from fitting a function to the demand curve is the rate of 
change in elasticity,
where elasticity is the proportional change in consumption relative to a proportional
change in price [@gilroy2020elasticity].

[^1]: Although we acknowledge the differences between consumption and purchasing and between price and unit price, for simplicity we will refer to consumption as the primary dependent variable and price as the independent variable.

An in-depth discussion of the various metrics the demand curve provides and their 
associations with clinical measures is beyond the scope of this paper. For further 
discussion, we encourage readers to consult other texts [e.g., @roz2019cptreview; 
@kaplan2019beez; @martinez2021; @reed2013behecon].
Here, we will note that change in elasticity is one of several different metrics 
that a demand curve provides, along with intensity, $P_{max}$, $O_{max}$, and breakpoint. 
Whereas change in elasticity is necessarily derived based on the results of regression, 
intensity, which represents the level of consumption at free or near free costs, 
can be derived either by regression or by observing the data directly (e.g., how 
many drinks would someone take if they were free).. Breakpoint, 
or the first price at which nothing is consumed (either by self-report or by not 
earning the reinforcer) is most often observed directly from the data but can be 
derived using some equations [e.g., @zhao2016twopart]. Finally, $O_{max}$ (i.e., 
maximum expenditure across all the prices) and $P_{max}$ (i.e., either the price 
associated with $O_{max}$ or the price at which the demand curve shifts from an inelastic 
to elastic portion) can be observed from the data directly (e.g., finding the 
maximum expenditure among the prices tested) or derived [e.g., via exact solution, 
@gilroy2019exact]. Because breakpoint, $O_{max}$, and $P_{max}$ are easily obtained from 
the data and by existing tools [e.g., @gilroy2018dca; @gilroy2019exact; @kaplan2019beez; 
http://www.behavioraleconlab.com/resources---tools.html] and do not fundamentally differ due to 
differences in statistical fitting techniques, the analyses presented here will 
focus on the two primary indices generated from the demand curve: intensity and 
change in elasticity.

Just as there is variability in how demand is collected, there is variability in 
how demand is analyzed [@kaplan2018aptreview; @reed2020cptreview] and demand is 
typically analyzed in one of two ways. The first approach is to fit a demand 
model to the overall group-level consumption.  We call this the 
"fit-to-group" approach (see Table 1). The second "two-stage" approach is to fit a 
demand model separately to each individual dataset (stage 1) and use the resulting 
individual-subject demand parameter estimates in subsequent analyses (stage 2).
The "fit-to-group" approach is shown in the top panel of 
Figure \@ref(fig:illustrate-demand-approaches-plot)
and the "two-stage" approach is shown in the bottom panel of 
Figure \@ref(fig:illustrate-demand-approaches-plot). Whereas these approaches are
relatively easy to execute, both methods have limitations that behavioral economists
conducting this research should be aware of and we will describe the relative
benefits and limitations later in this paper. To overcome some of these limitations, 
recent efforts in behavior analysis [@dehart2019mixed; @gilroy2020caregiver; @bottini2020tx] 
and behavioral economics 
[@young2017multilevel; @collins2014marijuana; @liao2013leftcensored; @zhao2016twopart; 
@acuff2021social; @kaplan2020lownic; @powell2020nicreduction; @strickland2016bdnf; @hofford2016cocaine] have been made 
to encourage the use of mixed-effects models (i.e., mixed-models, multilevel models), 
which is a modeling approach that integrates the relative advantages of these 
two approaches into a single stage analysis. However, we are not aware of any
accessible materials specifically tailored for behavioral economists for implementing the mixed-effects
modeling approach for behavioral economic demand.

As a result, the goal of the current article is to provide an easily accessible 
introduction and overview to mixed-effects models in studies of operant demand. 
A more in-depth 
discussion regarding the relative merits of the mixed-model approach in demand, 
including quantitative comparisons 
can be found in @yu2014analytic and others [@collins2014marijuana; @zhao2016twopart]. 
In the current paper, we will 
first discuss the nonlinear approach to fitting demand curve data and introduce 
important terminology and concepts (see Table 1). Then, we will orient readers 
to a previously published human hypothetical Alcohol Purchase 
Task dataset [@kaplan2018happyhour] consisting of a single sample of participants under one 
experimental condition. Using this dataset, we will illustrate the two common approaches 
to fitting demand curve data and discuss their relative benefits and limitations.
Then, we will provide an overview of nonlinear mixed-effects modeling 
and apply this approach to the dataset, comparing and contrasting with
the earlier approaches. We will then extend these analyses to a nonhuman dataset [@koffarnus2012monkey] 
with one sample of monkeys who each self-administered a series of drugs and other reinforcers.
Throughout we will conduct the analyses in the open-source `R` statistical software [@RCore]. 
To facilitate open-source documentation [@gilroy2019github], data and code to perform these analyses can 
be found at the corresponding authorâ€™s GitHub repository[^2]. That is,
all data and code necessary to reproduce the contents of this document, as well as additional 
figures and tables, are available as an R Markdown document (i.e., a document containing both 
text and code which can then be rendered into other document types)  in the 
GitHub repository. Whereas this article will remain static, the R Markdown document
will be updated occasionally based on advances and improvements in the `R` statistical
software. We encourage interested readers to consult and interact with
this R Markdown document.

In sum, we hope this paper will provide readers a high-level understanding of 
traditional approaches to analyzing demand curve data and limitations associated 
with those techniques, while also helping readers understand how mixed-effects 
modeling can enhance and help move towards best practices in demand analysis. 
Although we do not expect all readers will spontaneously start conducting all 
their demand analyses within a mixed-model methodology, we hope this paper 
might also help readers be able to better evaluate demand analyses. In addition, 
for those researchers who rely on or work closely with statisticians in their 
work, this paper and the associated R Markdown document may serve as an excellent 
resource for their collaborators. This paper, however, is not a strict tutorial 
on how to implement mixed-effects models nor on how to get started with the 
R statistical software[^3]. Those who have some familiarity with R will benefit 
greatly from executing the code line-by-line in the associated R Markdown document.

## Nonlinear fitting of demand curve data

Demand data are often fitted with a nonlinear exponential decay model using ordinary
least squares regression (see @gilroy2018dca; Table 1), which estimates 
parameter values (values that we do not know but wish to estimate with the collected
data) by minimizing the squared difference between observed consumption 
values and the predicted consumption values[^4]. The differences between the observed
and predicted data are referred to as the residuals. Due to the 
increasing use of hypothetical purchase tasks where zero values are often observed, 
the following nonlinear model [@koffarnus2015modified] has proven useful in 
characterizing these data:

[^4]: Later, we introduce how mixed-effects models are estimated within a frequentist paradigm using maximum-likelihood estimation. For a brief overview of maximum-likelihood estimation, see the Appendix.

\begin{equation}
Q_{j}=Q_{0}\cdot10^{k(e^{-\alpha Q_{0}C_{j}}-1)}+\varepsilon_{j},j=1,...,k\label{eq:koffeq}
\end{equation}

where $Q_{j}$ represents quantity of the commodity purchased/consumed at the $j$-th price 
point and $C_{j}$ is the $j$-th price, and these are known from the data. This
model estimates for $Q_{0}$, representing unconstrained purchasing when $C_{j}=\$0.00$
(i.e., the intercept), and $\alpha$, representing the rate of change in elasticity
across the demand curve (i.e., most analogous to a slope parameter; see 
@gilroy2020elasticity for more on the interpretation of elasticity in operant
demand). The term $k$ represents the range of data (e.g., quantities purchased) in 
logarithmic units and can be solved as a fitted parameter or can be set as a 
constant by determining _a priori_ an appropriate range. 
The model is structured as an exponential decay function so the $k$
parameter restricts the range of consumption to a specific lower non-zero asymptote. Finally,
the error ($\varepsilon$) term[^5] is assumed to be normally distributed with mean of
0 and variance of $\sigma^2$. We use this model *for illustrative purposes only* in this 
introduction, although mixed-effects models can be implemented on the demand model 
of the userâ€™s choice [e.g., @yu2014analytic; @liao2013leftcensored; @gilroy2021zbe], 
including the nonlinear model from which the above model was formulated [@hursh2008expo].
To be clear, the purpose of this introduction is not to compare different quantitative 
or conceptual models. The purpose of this paper is to provide a high-level overview 
of different *statistical fitting techniques regardless of the model chosen*. Readers 
are directed towards @strickland2016, @fragale2017neg, and @gilroy2021zbe for 
additional information regarding how different models perform.

[^5]: A reader might notice that the model formulations as described in @hursh2008expo and @koffarnus2015modified lack an explicit error term. Error terms are useful because they probabilistically describe the manner in which data depart from the regression line. Naturally, regression lines do not perfectly pass through observed data, regardless of whether the error term is made explicit in the description of the model. See Table 1 entry "error variance."

# Example Application: Human Hypothetical Purchase Task

## Dataset

The dataset is from @kaplan2018happyhour in which participants completed a hypothetical
Alcohol Purchase Task (APT; @kaplan2018aptreview). A total of `r nrow(apt)` participants
initially completed the task in full (four participants were excluded for missing data).
An additional `r length(unique(apt_unsys$id[apt_unsys$NumPosValues < 3]))` participants
were not included because they had less than three positive consumption values. 
The APT consisted of `r length(unique(apt_long$x))` prices, 
expressed as price per drink (\$0.00, \$0.25, \$0.50, \$1.00, \$1.50, \$2.00, 
\$2.50, \$3.00, \$4.00, \$5.00, \$6.00, \$7.00, \$8.00, \$9.00, \$10.00, 
\$15.00, and \$20.00). Participants reported how many alcoholic drinks they would
purchase and consume at each of the `r length(unique(apt_long$x))` prices.

### Systematicity

Stein and colleagues [@stein2015nonsystematic] proposed three criteria by which to suggest demand data 
are systematic. These criteria include 1) trend, 2) bounce, and 3) reversals from zero.
We applied these criteria to the data for identifying unsystematic 
response patterns. Overall, data were highly systematic with a total of 
`r length(unique(apt_unsys$id[apt_unsys$TotalPass != 3]))` unique participants 
failing at least one of the criteria. Although in typical approaches to analyzing
demand these unsystematic responses may be excluded, we will include
these cases to demonstrate the robustness of the mixed-model estimates of $Q_0$ 
and $\alpha$. Although we recommend researchers screen
for systematicity and report these numbers, ultimately the researcher must
determine whether to retain these participant datasets in a mixed-effects model analysis.
One approach we recommend is to analyze the data including all participants and 
compare these results to the subset of data which pass the criteria to determine
whether the removal of nonsystematic data alters the interpretation of results 
[@young2017multilevel].

## Common Approaches to Analyzing Demand Curve Data

In our experience with the literature, there are two primarily common ways to 
analyze demand curve data. These approaches are differentiated by whether the
study is interested in inferring what is common across individuals (fit-to-group
approach) or is interested in inferring the degrees and causes of variation 
among the individuals (two-stage approach). Said another way, the former approach
is primarily concerned with making generalizations about the broader "population"
(as defined in each experiment) whereas the latter approach is primarily concerned
with individual trends. 

### Fit-to-Group Approach

We have observed two ways in which researchers fit a single curve to the overall 
group when they are interested in making population-level inferences. In the 
interest of full clarity and recommendation that researchers specify their method 
of analysis in future research, we name and distinguish these two ways. However, 
both of these approaches treat variability in the data incorrectly and thus 
produce inaccurate measures of precision (i.e. standard errors) for estimators, 
which leads to misleading and/or incorrect statistical inference.

##### Fitting to means. 
The first method relies on averaging individual participant responses within a 
group at each price, then fitting a single curve through the series of price-specific 
group means [e.g., @hursh2008expo]. This method, therefore, fits a 
curve to _n_ data points, where _n_ equals the number of prices. By replacing the full 
data with a series of sample means, overall variability in the data is overlooked. 
This replacement leads to unrealistic standard errors that are typically much 
smaller than appropriate. This method can result in astonishingly high $R^{2}$ values 
(â‰¥ .97), but the "excellent fits" are an outcome of the substantially reduced 
variability [e.g., see @kaplan2018bagdemand; @hursh2008expo]. 
Thus, this method is not appropriate for statistical inference and is suitable 
for descriptive, graphical, and theoretical equation testing [e.g., @hursh2008expo] 
purposes only.

##### Pooling data. 
The second method relies on "pooling" all participant data together and fitting 
a single curve through _n_ * _k_ data points, where _n_ equals the number of prices 
and _k_ equals the number of participants. This method implicitly assumes all 
data points (even those gathered on the same individual) are independent, which 
is not realistic. This implicit assumption of independence among all data is not 
reasonable and leads to incorrect standard errors for estimators.

These two methods of the fit-to-group approach typically result in nearly identical 
point estimates (e.g., $Q_{0}$, $\alpha$) but differ in the size of the estimates' standard 
errors and the model's residual standard error (i.e., the amount of information 
"left over" and not accounted for by the model). It is important to recognize 
that neither of these approaches furnish correct, realistic statistical inference, 
but fortunately the next two approaches work better. For the purposes of this 
paper when we refer to the "fit-to-group" approach we are referring to the "pooling" 
method (i.e., we fit the model to _n_ * _k_ data points), which retains all individual 
subject data. At the time of this writing, this pooled method is the default in 
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com), 
a common curve-fitting program used by behavioral economists. In the R package 
_beezdemand_ [@kaplan2019beez], the user must specify the method in which they 
want the data aggregated (e.g., "mean" or "pooled").

#### Illustration of the fit-to-group approach

The current Alcohol Purchase Task dataset is comprised of only one group, therefore this approach will yield 
one $Q_{0}$ and one $\alpha$ for the entire sample (i.e., population-level fixed 
effect; see Table 1). No individual-specific parameters
can be estimated using this approach. Visually, we can see the 
results of this method in Figure \@ref(fig:fit-to-group-plot). 
The left panel shows the overall fit from this model in red along with the observed 
individual responses and the vertical lines at each price represent 
the interquartile range (the middle 50% of the data). The right panel displays a 
subset of individual participants and their responses. Note how the red lines 
(the prediction from the model) are identical across individual participant plots 
because this method only returns population-level estimates of $Q_{0}$ and $\alpha$.

```{r fit-to-group-plot, results = 'asis', fig.cap = "Fit-to-group approach. Left panel: Individual points in gray and subset of participants from right panel in blue. Black vertical bars indicate the interquartile range between 25% and 75%. The red line shows the predictions from the fit-to-group approach. Right panel: A subset of participants and their reported responses. The red line is identical to the fit-to-group approach demonstrating each participant has the identical predicted values. Visual inspection reveals that the estimated trend in red is inadequate to characterize the data for a number of participant datasets (e.g., Nonsys Increase, Max Q0).", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 9}

#### Benefits and limitations of the Fit-to-Group Approach

A benefit to preprocessing data into means prior to curve fitting is that 
no data need to be necessarily excluded. 
Participants who report zero consumption (incompatible with the 
log scale of analysis in some equations) can still be included as curves are fit
to the averaged data, so long as some participants in the sample have greater than 
zero consumption. Typically, convergence (i.e., the state when the fitting algorithm 
obtains a set of parameter estimates based on some predefined threshold) is more easily 
achieved when the model is fit to averaged consumption data or using the pooled method, effectively 
smoothing abrupt transitions from one price to the next, which is a response
pattern sometimes observed at the individual level (e.g., see "Median $\alpha$" 
plot in Figure \@ref(fig:fit-to-group-plot)). Notwithstanding these benefits, 
this approach is limited (beyond the statistical issues we outlined above) in 
that all participants share the same 
$Q_{0}$ and $\alpha$ values and as such, 
participant-level comparisons cannot be conducted. This approach does not allow for
investigations into how participant-specific demand parameters may relate to other
factors (e.g., response to treatment, demographic variables). In addition, any inferences 
made at the group level should not be assumed to hold true at the individual level, 
as this is known as the "ecological fallacy" [@robsinson1950fallacy]. 

### Two-stage approach

The second commonly used approach is to fit a regression model to each participant. 
Unlike the fit-to-group approach, the two-stage approach does not try and fit the average 
response pattern over all participants. 
Rather, subject-specific $Q_{0}$ and $\alpha$ values are 
estimated in the first stage. The second stage is to make inferences about 
variation in the fitted $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{Q_{0}}$ values 
using other statistical tests such as t-tests, analysis of variance, or even 
mixed-effects models.

#### Illustration of the Two-Stage Apporach

For this dataset (`r length(unique(apt_long$id))` participants), a total of 
`r nrow(apt_nopool[!is.na(apt_nopool$q0),])` demand curves were able to be fit, 
each resulting in a $\hat{Q_{0}}$ and an $\hat{\alpha}$ value. Unique to the two-stage
approach is that occasionally (depending on the task and participant sample) certain
participant's data are especially difficult or unable to be fit using operant
demand models. The failure to converge may be due to relatively few positive consumption 
values, that these data do not follow the "typical" downward sloping function, or 
that starting values are not appropriately identified. As a result, 
a total of `r nrow(apt_nopool[is.na(apt_nopool$q0),])` participants' data were 
excluded from this analysis. The left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:two-stage-plot) depicts the 
individual fits to a subset of participants' data. Contrast 
Figure \@ref(fig:two-stage-plot) with Figure \@ref(fig:fit-to-means-plot). Whereas this two-stage 
approach will typically result in predicted lines fitting closest to the data 
(compared to other approaches), such
predictions may not be "generalizable" to either other participants (or individuals
in a population) or other experimental conditions. That is, relatively more parameter
fits are being conducted than what is necessary. This lack of generalizability
is partly due to the model being optimized to a small amount of data relative to 
what else is "known" in the experiment (e.g., do other participants respond 
in similar ways to an experimental manipulation, do participants tend to respond
more similarly to their own other responses regardless of other experimental manipulations).

#### Benefits and limitations of the Two-Stage Approach

A benefit of the two-stage approach is that demand parameters at the individual participant
level can be obtained and used for downstream (i.e., stage 2) comparisons. Several limitations
are associated with this approach. One limitation is that demand parameters 
may be either very difficult to estimate or not estimable for some 
participants with sparse data (e.g., only one or two 
positive consumption values) or with extreme "step" response patterns with abrupt
decreases in consumption from one price to the next. These exclusions limit the 
scope of inference to those individuals at least somewhat described by the model.
That is, if derived parameter values ($Q_{0}$ and $\alpha$) from response patterns 
that do not follow the "typical" downward sloping function are not able to be 
estimated using traditional fitting algorithms, then downstream comparisons will 
be limited to a subset of the overall sample (this limit of scope is similar to 
when data that only meet systematic inclusion criteria [Stein et al., 2015] are 
included in an analysis).
Another limitation is that individual $Q_{0}$ and $\alpha$
are treated as perfectly accurate estimates with no error when these parameters
are used in subsequent statistical tests. Naturally, the first stage model fits
are imperfect, yet none of this uncertainty carries forward to the second stage of
analysis. Any second stage analysis will assume the participant-specific demand 
parameters provided are known with complete certainty and this will provide inaccurate
estimates of associated standard errors. This approach also disregards 
_intrasubject_ correlations across experimental conditions, which can also affect
the estimates in subsequent analyses unless special care is taken to model these
correlations. Intrasubject correlation refers to the association shared between data points 
collected within the same subject and is a commonly observed phenomenon in repeated 
measures studies.This "two-stage" approach - where 
demand parameters are obtained in the first step and compared in a separate, second
step - may result in biased conclusions and generalizability may be compromised.
This approach also lacks philosophical appeal since there is no overarching model that
relates individual subject parameter estimates to the population average that 
are of interest to researchers.

Each of these two approaches discussed have their relative benefits and drawbacks. 
An ideal method of incorporating the benefits of each approach would be conducted in 
a single stage, use all available data, incorporate covariates and experimental factors
(which are usually only addressed at the second stage), and result in "population" 
level estimates (see Table 1) while also providing individual level 
predictions and accounting for intrasubject correlation. The mixed-effects modeling 
approach we describe next has precisely these characteristics.

## Mixed-effects models

Several key concepts related to the mixed-effects modeling approach need to be 
discussed. Recall in the fit-to-group approach, we referred to the resulting group-level 
estimates "fixed effects" because they are considered common to all
individuals within a group and thus invariant within the observational unit (i.e.,
participant). At the highest degrees of generality, fixed effects may describe 
the underlying population structure and do not vary from one individual to the 
next.

A random effect is a model term that varies from one individual or sub-group 
to the next. To model this variation, random effects
are governed by probability distributions. These random effects can be 
thought of as *deviations around population level fixed effects.* By specifying 
random effects on model parameters ($Q_{0}$,  $\alpha$),
we allow a given participant to deviate relatively higher or relatively lower
around the population average fixed effects. On
average, these random-effect deviations will equal 0, which is just a different way of
saying that on average, the individual estimates will equal the population level 
estimates.

The mixed-model approach introduces the ideas of _shrinkage_ and _partial pooling_,
which come into play when the dataset contains values unusually far from the average.
For example, suppose a participant in our dataset shows much higher consumption
compared to many other participants in the group. In the two-stage approach, the 
estimated parameters for this participant will be far from the average. 
While this may certainly be a valid dataset and response pattern, unusually high (or low) values 
inflate estimates of individual error variance. The inflated error introduces 
greater uncertainty the individual's parameter estimates, which in turn inflates 
uncertainty in downstream analyses of individual variation in those parameters. 
In this way, error propagates through each step of the analysis, resulting in 
confidence intervals of second stage estimates that do not accurately reflect 
error variance from the first stage. Importantly, if no additional steps are 
taken to integrate error over each step, then estimates of the confidence intervals 
and other inferential statistics are likely to be incorrect.
Rather, in a mixed-model approach, information from the entire group is leveraged 
to *shrink* the imprecise estimates back towards the group average. Because this 
benefit relies on anomalous estimates having a certain degree of imprecision, 
the estimates may not differ drastically from the two-stage approach in sufficiently 
large samples. In the mixed-model approach, the fixed effects will more
closely reflect the underlying response patterns of the individuals (e.g., these
fixed effect estimates will be influenced less by unusually high or low values) 
as will the random effects (estimates associated with each participant) be more 
reflective of the pattern of responding of the group as a whole (see Ch. 13 of 
@mcelreath2018rethinking for additional examples).

The most extreme case of parameter imprecision occurs when, due to anomalies in 
the data, one or more parameters do not have a solution (i.e., the likelihood 
function is flat and the parameter sampling error is infinity). In our example, 
the center-bottom pane of Figure \@ref(fig:two-stage-plot) shows an individual that altogether lacks 
the variation in responses needed to estimate both $k$ and $\alpha$. In that case, the 
model will not converge to a solution, and the resulting parameter estimates may 
take extreme values that will exert relatively greater influence on parameter estimates
and the associated standard errors in the second step of the analysis. 
The principle of shrinkage applies to these scenarios most of all by forcing 
non-estimable parameters to take the values of their group means and thus have no 
influence on subsequent inferences. This effect could be regarded as an automatic 
mechanism of imputation (i.e., assigning or determining a value based on inference 
from other data with common characteristics) given insufficiently informative 
data on some individuals.

On the other hand, standard errors resulting from the fit-to-group approach may 
be "artificially" small due to the inclusion of all participant data while also 
treating all data as independent. However, repeated measures on the same subject 
are typically correlated, thus containing some of the same information. In the 
presence of a positive correlation, standard errors should be larger than if the 
data are independent since there is less unique information in the data for a 
given sample size. This is one reason why standard errors from the fit-to-group 
approach are unlikely to accurately reflect the true precision in the estimate. 
Generally, small standard errors suggest a high degree of precision in the 
estimates (even if the estimates are not completely accurate) and this size will 
affect inferences from statistical tests (e.g., considering if a difference is 
statistically significant or not). While the size of the standard errors associated 
with the fit-to-group approach, though, are unlikely to be accurate, simulation 
studies have shown standard errors resulting from mixed-effects modeling tend to 
be more accurate [e.g., @ho2016bayesian; @yu2014analytic] by including all data 
and recognizing the correlation present within subjects. 

#### Illustration of Mixed-Effects Models

Adapting the behavioral economic demand model (Eq. 1) for use in the mixed-effects
model framework yields:

\begin{equation}
Q_{ij}=Q_{0_{i}}\cdot10^{k(e^{-\alpha_{i}Q_{0_{i}}C_{ij}}-1)}+\varepsilon_{ij},i=1,...,n,j=1,...,c
\end{equation}

where here $Q_{ij}$ represents quantity of the commodity purchased/consumed
by the $i$-th _participant_ at the $j$-th price 
point and $C_{ij}$ is the $j$-th price associated with the $i$-th participant 
(again these are known from the data). $Q_{0_{i}}$ and $\alpha_{i}$ represent 
intensity and rate of change in elasticity associated with the 
$i$-th participant. Finally, the error ($\varepsilon_{ij}$) term is error associated 
with each individual. This and any other mixed-effects model can be expanded into
matrix notation, which can be found in the Appendix.

In the statistical program, R, there are several functions and packages for fitting nonlinear
mixed-effects models. For the purposes of this paper, we use `nlme` from
the `nlme` package (@pinheironlme; see also `nlmer` from the `lme4` package, for example). 
As mentioned earlier, the code necessary to reproduce all figures and analyses 
are available in the corresponding author's GitHub[^6].

We can see the results of the mixed-effects models in Figure \@ref(fig:nlme-apt-fit-plot). 
Several things are important to note. First, notice this model provides group-level
fixed-effects predictions (left panel; red prediction line) and participant level 
predictions (blue and gray lines) obtained 
from _adding the fixed and random effects together_ because, again, 
the random effects are _deviations around_ the group-level fixed effects associated
with individual subject data.
In the left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:nlme-apt-fit-plot) we see the group-level 
fixed-effect predictions approximate the average of all the lines and look similar to
the left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:fit-to-group-plot). In the right panel of Figure 
\@ref(fig:nlme-apt-fit-plot) we see the participant level predictions match closely
to the individual points and look similar to the right panel of Figure 
\@ref(fig:two-stage-plot). Figure S1 in the supplementary materials shows how these 
two approaches differ by overlying these lines on the raw consumption data.

Figure \@ref(fig:fixed-summary-plot) displays the estimates and the standard 
errors associated with the three 
approaches for log($Q_{0}$) and log($\alpha$). This figure nicely illustrates the relative 
advantage of the mixed-effects modeling approach with respect to the size and 
accuracy of the standard errors, as discussed previously. On the left side of the 
graph, the fit-to-group approach (circles) shows substantially smaller standard 
errors, whereas the middle points (two-stage approach; squares) show larger standard 
errors. Notice the size of the standard errors associated with the mixed-effects 
modeling approach (diamonds) is more similar to the two-stage approach, 
suggesting the fit-to-group approach overestimated the precision of the estimates. 
The size and accuracy of 
standard errors are important when conducting statistical tests to determine the 
extent to which certain values of $Q_{0}$ and $\alpha$ may be statistically different across 
two or more experimental groups or conditions. Too narrow of standard errors are 
likely to inflate Type I error (erroneously rejecting the null hypothesis and 
concluding an effect or difference exists when it does not), whereas too wide of 
standard errors are likely to inflate Type II error (failing to reject the null 
hypothesis and concluding the difference or effect does not exist when it does). 
Accuracy and proper size of standard errors is critically important for comparisons 
such as whether a certain drug maintains a higher abuse liability than another; 
an example we will illustrate using a nonhuman dataset later in this paper.

Notice how the population-level fixed effects provides a best-fit line slightly lower than the fit-to-group approach. The mixed-effects model is able to provide random effect predictions for some datasets with low and flat line consumption values (e.g., 'static' dataset bottom row of right panel), which influences the population level fixed effects, while also shrinking predictions from datasets with high consumption values. Right panel: A subset of participants and their responses. The maroon lines show the best fit lines from the two-stage approach for each participant. The gray lines show the predicted lines from the random effects obtained from the mixed-effects model approach. Overall, the lines show close correspondence with the bottom row yielding predicted lines from only the mixed-effects model approach."}

Up to this point, we have demonstrated how the mixed-effects model can be applied
to a single group and how estimates differ from the fit-to-group and two-stage
approaches. We now discuss how these mixed-effects models can be extended to 
different types of experimental designs, including between subject and
within-subject designs.

# Extending the Mixed-Effects Model

## Between-subject designs

Extending the mixed-effects models described here to between-subject designs 
comparing two or more groups at a single timepoint 
is straightforward and relatively simple. For these designs, an additional
fixed effect representing the between-subject experimental manipulation is 
added[^7]. The random effects structure remains the same. Additional covariates 
or variables of interest can be added in much the same way that a fixed-effect 
term representing a between-subject experimental manipulation can be added.

[^7]: In the R statistical software, adding a fixed effect term is as easy as adding "+ fixed_term" in the fixed argument of nlme. For additional insight into model formulation see @pinheiro2000nlme, as well as the comments in the R Markdown document at https://github.com/brentkaplan/mixed-effects-demand.

# example of adding covariates/fixed-effects
# make sure you add the correct number of starting values and you
# will also need to make reasonable guesses as to the values of those
# starting values 
# (i.e., is the difference b/w male and female reasonable at .5? 2? 5?)
# the following are just examples and the researcher should ensure
# the model is specified correctly and the estimates are sensible
# never trust the output of the functions blindly!

# # one q0 and one alpha per person
# fixed = list(q0 ~ 1,
#              alpha ~ 1)
# 
# # one q0 and one alpha per group
# fixed = list(q0 ~ group,
#              alpha ~ group)
# 
# # one q0 and one alpha per group supressing the intercept
# fixed = list(q0 ~ group -1,
#              alpha ~ group -1)
# 
# # one q0 and one alpha as a function of a numeric variable
# fixed = list(q0 ~ numeric_var,
#              alpha ~ numeric_var)
# 
# # one q0 and one alpha per group and addition of a covariate
# # on both q0 and alpha
# fixed = list(q0 ~ group + covariate,
#              alpha ~ group + covariate)
# 
# # interaction between fixed effects giving a full factorial
# fixed = list(q0 ~ group*variable2,
#              alpha ~ group*variable2)
# 
# # interaction between fixed effects giving a full factorial
# # and additional covariate
# fixed = list(q0 ~ group*variable2 + covariate,
#              alpha ~ group*variable2 + covariate)


# # one random intercept of q0 and alpha per person
# random = pdDiag(q0 + alpha ~ 1)
# 
# # blocked random effects: one random intercept for alpha/q0 at the individual level
# # one random intercept for each level of group for q0 and alpha
# random = pdBlocked(list(pdDiag(q0 + alpha ~ 1),
#                         pdDiag(q0 + alpha ~ group - 1)))
# 
# 
# # blocked random effects: one random intercept for alpha/q0 at the individual level
# # one random slope for q0 and alpha across a numeric variable
# random = pdBlocked(list(pdDiag(q0 + alpha ~ 1),
#                         pdDiag(q0 + alpha ~ numeric_variable - 1)))
#

```

## Crossed and nested designs

Special care must be taken to understand the experimental design and data structure
to properly specify how the random effects should be estimated in
designs incorporating repeated measurements. Two types of these designs are crossed 
and nested design. For example, a nested design might measure 
demand over several days
among two groups of participants with one group receiving active medication and
the other group receiving placebo. These demand measurements are nested within
participant and participant is nested within drug group (active vs. placebo). 
However, drug group is a between-groups factor because a participant can be in
only one group or the other. These types of models are most easily implemented in
various mixed-effects modeling packages in the R Statistical Software.

Crossed designs are those in which there are no inherent levels or nesting. For 
example, a crossed design might be measuring demand over consecutive days
among participants who experience two different doses of a drug. Whereas demand
measurements are nested within participant (similar to above), all participants
experience both doses of the drug. Therefore, there are sources of variation at 
both the participant level and at the experimental manipulation level but 
without exclusive nesting. Importantly, "... nested effects are an attribute of 
the data, not the model" [@erricksonWeb]. 
There may be experiments where no specific manipulation is 
implemented. In these cases, a mixed-effects model can still be fit and this model 
formulation will be relatively simple compared to more complex experimental designs.
Here we will illustrate an example of a nonhuman self-administration
dataset with no inherent levels of nesting between monkeys and drugs. We will 
demonstrate how the mixed-effects model can estimate multiple fixed effects
of interest (i.e., different reinforcers) and how we can use these models
to directly compare differences in demand parameters using null-hypothesis testing.

# Example Application: Nonhuman Self-Administration

The following example illustrates application of the mixed-effects model to 
nonhuman animal data published in @koffarnus2012monkey. The monkeys responded
on increasing fixed-ratio schedules (i.e., "prices") to earn infusions of the various reinforcers.
The drugs used included cocaine, ethanol, ketamine, methohexital, and remifentanil.
Two additional conditions were tested including food (sucrose pellets) and saline infusions. 

As we showed earlier in the paper, we will first demonstrate modeling by fitting a
single curve to all the data within each reinforcer (fit-to-group approach), 
as well as fitting to each monkey for each reinforcer (two-stage approach). 
Finally, we show how the mixed-effects model provides us with 
both predictions at the reinforcer level, as well as individual monkey level for 
each reinforcer, and how we can use estimated marginal means (i.e., least-square means)
to compare reinforcing efficacy ($\alpha$) of the reinforcers.

### Fit-to-group and two-stage approaches
Our first approach fits a single demand curve to each of the seven reinforcers. 
This was the analysis method used in the original paper [@koffarnus2012monkey].
The left panel of Figure S2 (Supplemental Materials) displays the fitted curve 
to each of the reinforcers, the 25% and 75% interquartile range (vertical black 
lines), and the individual data. The right panel 
shows these group-level fits within each monkey. Notice here how for some monkeys, 
the predicted lines are far from the points (e.g., Saline for LE, TI). This 
discrepancy between the population-level predictions and some proportion of 
the individual data is similar to what was observed with the Alcohol 
Purchase Task dataset. Figure \@ref(fig:monkey-coefs-plot) displays the estimates and standard errors from 
the model (circles) and results from the analyses show Saline resulted in the highest 
log($\alpha$) and Cocaine and Remifentanil with the lowest. Other reinforcers were intermediary.

As in the human example, we show the first stage of fitting the model using the 
two-stage approach. We encounter the same
limitations as in the human example; namely, we are unable to derive population-level
(i.e., reinforcer-level) estimates of $Q_{0}$ or $\alpha$ and we are unable to obtain
individual-level fits for BU Ethanol. The left panel of Figure S3 
shows the individual monkey fits within each reinforcer and the right panel 
displays these fits within each monkey and for each reinforcer. As is expected, 
these lines fit the individual data well. Figure \@ref(fig:monkey-coefs-plot) displays 
the averaged estimates and 
standard errors from this two-stage approach (squares). The results of this approach are 
consistent with those of the fit-to-group approach â€“ Saline and Cocaine/Remifentanil 
showing the highest and lowest log($\alpha$), respectively.

### Mixed-effects model
Figure \@ref(fig:monkey-mixedmodel-plot) displays the results of the mixed-effects
modeling approach. Both panels show prediction lines from the fixed-effect
estimates for each of the drugs (thick lines) and the subject-level predictions
from the random effects (light lines). As shown and demonstrated in the human 
example, the mixed-effects model provides information (i.e., predictions) at the
population level (in this case the reinforcer level) as well as at the individual level.
In this mixed-effects model, we fit each reinforcer as a nominal (categorical) fixed 
effect. In models where categorical fixed effects are used, we can use estimated 
marginal means to compare the values of log($\alpha$) for each nominal category. Estimated 
marginal means provide the mean response values for a modelâ€™s factors adjusting 
for any covariates [@lenth2019]. In the current models, the estimated marginal 
means are equivalent to the model effects given there are no covariates for which 
to account. The values are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:monkey-coefs-plot) (diamonds). The results of the 
mixed-effects model are consistent with the findings from the traditional approaches, 
suggesting Saline and Cocaine/Remifentanil maintained the highest 
(lowest reinforcing value) and lowest (highest reinforcing value) log($\alpha$), respectively.

#### Comparing Coefficient Values
One additional benefit of fitting these nonlinear mixed-effects demand models is 
the relative ease in which statistical comparisons can be made. Using the fit-to-group 
approach, traditional methods of statistical tests are largely limited to those 
such as the Extra Sum-of-Squares F-test and comparisons in Akaike Information 
Criteria (AIC, AICc). Using the two-stage approach, comparisons techniques are 
more numerous and range in complexity (e.g., $t$-tests, analysis of variance, 
mixed-effects models). The relative benefits and drawbacks of these comparison 
methods will not be contrasted here; rather, we note that post hoc pairwise 
comparisons can be determined directly from the model and with no need to extract 
parameter values and use in subsequent tests, as is required in the two-stage 
approach. For example, we used a powerful and flexible R package [emmeans; @lenth2019] 
to conduct pairwise comparisons ($t$-tests) of log($\alpha$) from the mixed-effects model 
and adjusted p-values using false discovery rate (see Table S1). The results 
suggest largely conform to those displayed in the bottom panel of Figure \@ref(fig:monkey-coefs-plot). 
Salineâ€™s log($\alpha$) was statistically significantly higher (lower valuation) than 
all other reinforcers tested. Cocaine and Remifentanilâ€™s log($\alpha$)'s were significantly 
lower (higher valuation) compared to all other reinforcers except Food and each other.

## Other Considerations
Beyond the introduction and basic concepts laid out here in the re-analysis
of a human Alcohol Purchase Task dataset and nonhuman self-administration dataset, there are
additional considerations for fitting mixed-effects models to behavioral
economic operant demand data. One consideration is the determination
of convergence criteria. Convergence criteria can be relatively lenient (i.e.,
finding "good enough" estimates and looking no further after the criteria is met) 
or they can be relatively strict. With data that follow the typical exponential 
decay function of demand (i.e., systematic), convergence can more easily be obtained under strict 
criteria. With data that are relatively more "unsystematic," strict criteria may
not result in convergence and these criteria may need to be relaxed (e.g., increasing
tolerance). Another reason
convergence may not be achieved is because starting values may be too far away
from the optimal solution. This problem is also present in traditional approaches
to fitting demand curve data (e.g., fit-to-group, two-stage) and nonlinear modeling
in general. If convergence issues are encountered, we suggest relaxing the 
convergence criteria until a solution is determined. Then the estimates from 
this model may be used as starting values for another model where convergence 
criteria are tightened once more. Given the complexity of demand curve data and 
some quantitative models to describe these data, some amount of relaxation of 
convergence criteria may be acceptable (in our anecdotal experience, we have found 
tolerance < 0.01 may be an acceptable limit). However, when encountering datasets 
or models that do show difficulty converging, the researcher should ensure they 
are specifying the model correctly and may consider reporting difficulty fitting 
the model.

Finally, mixed-effects models may be solved using Bayesian methods and Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as opposed to maximum likelihood estimation. Methods such as 
these have been successfully applied to behavioral economic demand data [@ho2016bayesian].
MCMC has the added benefits of producing empirical posterior (or under frequentist 
assumptions, sampling) distributions for all parameters in the model and does 
not suffer from certain convergence problems with maximum likelihood estimation 
in small samples. Several 
packages in the R statistical software can solve mixed-effects models using 
Bayesian methods (e.g., brms, rstanarm). We recommend one package in particular, 
brms, as this package provides even greater flexibility than nlme or lme4 and 
the syntax (e.g., writing the model) is highly similar to that of lme4.

# Conclusion
Mixed-effects models are becoming a more popular means by which to analyze complex
behavioral economic demand data. Although this modeling technique is more complicated
than traditional approaches to analysis (i.e., fit-to-group, two-stage), our goal
here is to make the motivation, interpretation, and execution of the mixed-effects
modeling technique more accessible for the analysis of demand data. In this paper 
we have used two datasets (i.e., a hypothetical purchase task, nonhuman animal 
self-administration) to 1) illustrate
the traditional approaches to demand modeling, 2) discuss the relative benefits and
limitations of these approaches, 3) provide an overview of the mixed-effects
framework, 4) illustrate the results of this framework, and 5) describe how results
from the mixed-effects modeling technique correspond with the traditional methods. 
In order to facilitate execution of these techniques, we have made a fully reproducible
document available at the corresponding author's GitHub page as a repository. There,
this code can be inspected, executed, and adapted for researchers' own endeavors.

*A Word about Maximum-Likelihood Estimation*

Mixed-effects models are typically solved
via maximum-likelihood estimation (see Table 1; note these 
models can also be solved via other techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo
but this is beyond the scope of the current paper). 
A brief overview of this approach follows. First, a likelihood function 
(which relates to the observed data
to the parameters the experimenter is interested in) is evaluated for an initial
candidate set of parameters during a single iteration of the model evaluation. 
The algorithm assesses the shape of the likelihood surface at these parameter values,
then picks a new set of parameter values to achieve a higher likelihood in the next
iteration. The model continues to iteratively select both individual subject (i.e.,
random effect) and group (i.e., fixed effect) parameter values and evaluate 
the likelihood in this manner until the algorithm reaches the maximum of the 
likelihood function. This final set of random- and fixed-effect values is the 
set which make the
observed data "most likely" to have occurred, and thus serve as the parameter 
estimates based on the observed data. Restricted maximum likelihood is frequently
used for mixed-effects models since it typically produces variance estimates with
less bias than traditional maximum likelihood [@liao2002reml; @meza2007reml]. However, 
regular maximum likelihood
estimation is used for comparing fixed effects across different mixed-effects models.
For more in-depth discussion, see [@bates2014fitting]. 
The primary difference, therefore, between maximum likelihood estimation 
and nonlinear least squares regression is that the 
former determines the coefficients that maximize the probability of the observed
data, whereas the latter minimizes the error (deviations between the predicted and
observed values). 

*Expanding into Matrix Notation*

We expand this in matrix notation to describe how the individual estimates $Q_{0_{i}}$ 
and $\alpha_{i}$ are the sum of the fixed effects $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ and
random effects $b_{1i}$ and $b_{2i}$. The random effects $\boldsymbol{b_{i}}$ are distributed
based on a multivariate normal ($MN$) distribution with mean 0 and variance equal
to $\varPsi$. Because the $\boldsymbol{b_{i}}$ random effects index the individual, 
we assume the sampling distribution of these two effects may be correlated to 
some extent with each other, which is shown in the expansion of $\varPsi$. 

\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
Q_{0_{i}}\\
\alpha_{i}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\beta_{1}\\
\beta_{2}
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}
b_{1i}\\
b_{2i}
\end{array}\right)=\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\beta}+b_{i},b_{i}}\sim MN(0,\varPsi),\varepsilon_{ij}\sim N(0,\sigma^{2}f(p_{j})),
\]

and 

\[
\varPsi=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma_{1}^{2} & \sigma_{12}\\
\sigma_{12} & \sigma_{2}^{2}
\end{array}\right)
\]

In essence, the fixed effects $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ are analogous
to the parameters we obtain from the fit-to-mean approach and the random effects 
$b_{1i}$ and $b_{2i}$ are analogous to those we obtain from the two-stage approach.
Here the difference is we leverage all the available data; in other words, how does the sample
as a whole respond (i.e., fixed effects) and how do individuals respond _relative_ to 
the sample (i.e., random effects).
